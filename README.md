"Approachable Artifical Neural Network" aims to drastically lower the barrier of entry for the Artifical Neural Network AI and NEAT learning Algorithm within the context of Unity Game Development.
This Project was created for my final exam at the [S4G School for Games](https://www.school4games.net/).

# Overview
This project lowers the barrier of entry in three major ways:

 ### 1. Documentation
The project comes with a [Documentation](https://github.com/BasKrueger/Approachable-Artifical-Neural-Network/blob/main/Documentation.pdf) that not only goes over how to make use of this project, but also provides deeper insight into the AI algorithm that's behind everything.

 ### 2. Usability
The rather complex AI Algorithm gets boiled down to three very simple questions:
1. What can the AI see?
2. What can the AI do?
3. When does the AI something good/bad?

Once these three things are set, you are ready to start your first test drive.

 ### 3. Editor Extensions
Provided Editor Scripts help you to better understand the AI by visualizing various aspects, 
giving you quick access to a varierty of functions as with inspector buttons, as well as giving your helpful reminder at various occasions.

# How to Run
Simply download the reposetory and open the "Project" folder using at least Unity 2022.3
